    <h1>SONG OF THE DAY</h1>
    <p>
        i had a #song-of-the-day channel in a friend server i was in, and i wasn't posting on there as much so i made this!
    </p>

    <p>
        i pretty much have spotify's api search up some songs and get one of the tracks<br />
        the search query list is kinda small though so if you want me to add one
        query, lmk!
    </p>
